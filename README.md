# Classification of subgroups with immune characteristics based on DNA methylation in luminal breast cancer 

Luminal breast cancer (BC) is a large proportion with highly heterogeneous across patients in BC. It is a challenge of the precise subtype and optimal selection of treatment options in the lu-minal BC. In the study, we proposed a framework MSBR, integrating DNA methylation profile and transcriptome to identify immune subgroups of luminal BC. MSBR was implemented both on a key module scoring algorithm and “Boruta” feature selection method by DNA methylation. Luminal A was divided into two subgroups and luminal B into three subgroups using MSBR. Furthermore, these subgroups were defined different immune subgroups in luminal A and B respectively. The subgroups had significant differences in DNA methylation levels, immune microenvironment (immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoint PD1/PDL1 expression, im-mune cell cracking activity (CYT)) and pathology features (Texture, Eccentricity, Intensity and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)). The results also found that there is a subgroup both in luminal A and B that has the benefit from immunotherapy. This study proposed to classify lu-minal breast cancer from the perspective of epigenetics and immune characteristics, which pro-vided individualized treatment decisions.
